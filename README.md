# Vigenere-Encoder
This is a C program that takes the key and a message as files, encrpyts the message using the Vigenere cipher. The program removes any non-alphabetic characters from the message, pads it with X's until it is a multiple of the key's length, and then encrypts it using the Vigenere cipher algorithm. The resulting ciphertext is displayed.

# Getting Started
  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Compile the program using a C compiler.
  3. Run the executable file.

# Usage
To use this algorithm, you will need to provide two input txt files: one containing a plaintext message and the other containing an encryption key. Sample input files are provided. Files beginning with k are example keys, while those beginning with p are plaintexts. For example, you can use k1.txt and p1.txt.

Once you have your input file ready, you can run the following commands to begin the program:

gcc Vigenere.c -o ./vigenere
./vigenere kX.txt pX.txt
